        "## ✨ Part 4: Ethical Reflection\n",
        "\n",
        "### Project: Predictive Maintenance Model for Urban Water Infrastructure\n",
        "\n",
        "**Concept:** The project involves building a machine learning model to predict which sections of a city’s water pipe network are most likely to fail due to corrosion or stress within the next five years. This informs budgeting and preventative repair schedules, moving from reactive fixes to proactive maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ethical Adherence Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure this project adheres to the core ethical AI principles, I would implement the following guidelines:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Justice (Fairness):**\n",
        "    -   **Challenge:** The primary risk is **Disparate Impact**. If training data heavily favors well-funded, modern neighborhoods (frequent sensor data, accurate repair logs), the model will be biased, predicting failures only in older, under-monitored, typically low-income areas. This leads to **under-allocation of preventative resources** where they are needed most, creating an unfair distribution of safety and service.\n",
        "    -   **Mitigation:** I would employ **Data Augmentation** or **Reweighting** (similar to what was discussed in Part 3) to artificially balance historical failure rates and sensor density based on the demographic distribution of the population served. I would use an **Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD)** metric to ensure the model’s True Positive Rate (correctly identifying a failure risk) is balanced across different socioeconomic zones.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Transparency and Explainability (XAI):**\n",
        "    -   **Challenge:** Civil engineers and municipal decision-makers need to trust the predictions. A black-box model is useless if it cannot justify spending millions on a specific pipe section.\n",
        "    -   **Mitigation:** The final model must be highly **Explainable**. I would use inherently transparent models (like boosted decision trees) or post-hoc techniques (like **SHAP values**) to justify every prediction by linking it directly to physical features (e.g., \"This pipe has a 90% risk because its Age is 85 years and its Material is cast iron, outweighing its low pressure reading\").\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Non-maleficence (Preventing Harm):**\n",
        "    -   **Challenge:** A model failure (False Negative) could lead to catastrophic pipe bursts, flooding, and public health risks.\n",
        "    -   **Mitigation:** Safety must be paramount. I would set the model threshold to prioritize **minimizing False Negatives (FN)** accepting a slightly higher rate of False Positives (predicting risk where none exists, leading to premature spending) to virtually eliminate the risk of a real, unpredicted infrastructure failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "By integrating these strategies, the model serves the public good (**Justice**), maintains professional accountability (**Explainability**), and protects public safety (**Non-maleficence**)."
